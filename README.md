# Career-Aspirations-of-GEN_Z-Power-BI-project

Business Problem: The project aimed to analyze the career trends and preferences of Gen-Z individuals worldwide, investigating factors such as influenced decision-making, higher education aspirations, preferred working environments, and attitudes towards companies' missions. The objective was to derive valuable insights using Power BI, a powerful data visualization and reporting tool.

Project Solution: The project began with data collection and cleaning to ensure data accuracy and consistency. The cleaned dataset was then imported into Power BI for further analysis and visualization. Power BI's capabilities were harnessed to create interactive dashboards and reports that facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the collected data.

Power BI's data modeling features were leveraged to establish relationships between different data tables, enabling the exploration of various dimensions and attributes. Measures and calculated columns were created to perform calculations and derive relevant metrics for analysis.

Through Power BI, visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps were created to present key insights related to preferred working environments, alignment between company missions and actions/products, preferred employers, desired learning environments, close-to-aspirational careers, managerial preferences, and willingness to work for companies with recent layoffs.

The interactive nature of Power BI allowed stakeholders to dynamically filter, drill down, and slice the data to gain deeper insights. This enabled them to make informed decisions based on the patterns and trends identified in the analysis.

The use of Power BI as a data visualization and reporting tool enhanced the project's data analysis capabilities, enabling stakeholders to explore and understand the career trends and preferences of Gen-Z individuals in a visually compelling and interactive manner. The project outcomes, methodologies, and Power BI visualizations were documented, providing valuable insights and actionable recommendations to drive informed decision-making.
